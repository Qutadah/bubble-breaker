Bubble Breaker
==============

A Javascript Clone of the Windows Mobile Evergreen, coupled with a Genetic Algorithm to find the best possible solution. (Before starting to play it!)

[Play the Demo here](http://blog.ginader.de/dev/bubble-breaker/index.php)


## Requirements:

* Google Chrome or Live-Server on Node.js or from chrome. \
* JavaScript compiler and code editor (VS-code)

```js
var add2 = function(number) {
  return number + 2;
}
```

## Known Issues:
* Genetic Algorithm and search functions are not yet fully implemented. (does not work yet)


## Bugs:
-

## Research papers:
* This algorithm is based on the research papers of:
